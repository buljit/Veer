        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <h4>
            The navigation of the product is very easy. Just imagine a home screen hovering where you look. You can do anything with it since
            only you can see it with your Tech Contacts.If you want it to shut down all you have to do is say close as the contacts hear down
            to 1 dB so you dont feel embarrased. You also do the same thing to open it back up. but before this happens you will need to create
            an account so for future and privacy purposes it helps you and us.
